Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
Colour-code each timeblock based on past, present and future when the timeblock is viewed.
Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
Persist events between refreshes of a page.
